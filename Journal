Understanding Third-party assessments
Rough draft of checklist:
  scoping questionaire
  scorecard
  items we request (HITRUST/SOC2/ISO)
  analyzing info
  followup questions
  documenting info on G: drive
  documenting assessment on vendor worksheet portal
  adding info to JIRA
  maybe even JAEDR - peripheral convo, not a requirement
  
  Data Security Addendedum - sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Sensitive University Data 
  will be protected by the Selected Firm/Vendor during the term of the Parties' Contract and after its termination.

Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, is a general term that is used to describe any form of sensitive data that could be used 
to identify or contact an individual. 
This term is not related to HIPAA and is not regulated by any one entity or in any one industry like PHI is. 

Protected Health Information, or PHI, is any medical information that can potentially identify an individual, that was created, 
used or disclosed in the course of providing healthcare services, whether it was a diagnosis or treatment.  

PHI can include information about: 

The past, present, or future physical health or condition of an individual 
Healthcare services rendered to an individual 
Past, present, or future payment for the healthcare services rendered to an individual, along with any of the identifiers shown below. 

The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines 18 identifiers that make health information PHI under HIPAA:

## Policy & Education meeting with Joel
- sarah wrote all the standards - best resource for knowledge, reasoning behind each standard
- Joel - just completed masters - started at nyulh last yr
- policy & education - document security policies and standards and promote cybersec awareness to nyulh community

To-Do -List

Create or Draft a standard
Meet SME to discuss what is required, why do we need this standard
Determine steps - record importatnt information - additional information. 

My Standard - Loaner Laptop Build Configuration Standard reference ITP-15 series
Come up with powerpoint for cybersecurity awareness 2022 - ideas recorded on sharepoint
Help security team with Jira issues



Section 3 Vulnerability Management

Tools- InsightVM/On-premise

Expand internship to one year.
Give each section more time to understand and complete assignments
Reduce reading material. Graduate students do a lot of research and reading. Need more hands on work.
Provide monitors with laptops
