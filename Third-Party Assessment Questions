What is a third-party vendor assessment?

A third-party risk assessment is an analysis of the risks introduced to your organization via third-party relationships along the supply chain. 
Those third parties can include vendors, service providers, software providers and other suppliers.

Third party security assessment questions

Are there any formal security programs in place?

How is data protected when in transit from the vendor to the client, end-user, etc.?

What are they actively doing to prevent breaches and how often do they check for vulnerabilities?

Assign each vendor with a security rating

Just as you would internally, conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment for each vendor. 
Assigning each with a security rating will help you further prioritize your vendor risk monitoring 
strategies as well as highlight where your efforts would be best spent on first.

Respond to security risks and define vendor performance metrics

Clearly define your expectations by setting metrics that allow you to easily monitor vendor performance on a regular basis. 
Keep these Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in mind when creating vendor contracts so you can ensure all organizations are up to standard.

Continuously monitor your vendors

The best way to maintain a strong cybersecurity posture across your ecosystem is to regularly monitor all third-party vendors 
and ensure efforts are still in place to protect important client and user data.
