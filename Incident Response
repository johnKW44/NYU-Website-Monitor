## incident response - the cyber team

intro to cyber team:
- focus: cyber threat intel, incident response
	- first one to respond when something is happening in the environment
	- primary job #1: IR, if something is happening we drop everything and respond
	- day-to-day : 
		- can be benign: lost device
		- can be severe: ransomware, outage calls
	- log4j, wannacry, notpetaya - team dealt with these
- have a process and playbook
	- playbook: categorization of all  types of incidents
		- steps for each type of incident
		- not an operations guide - so many tools/platforms, cant cover every little thing
		- goal is for analyst to know what to do in that category
- lots of technologies:
	- high level: anomali, splunk, crowdstrike
- investigations: part of team's responsibility
	- driven by legal/HR
	- incidents come from ciso (hai), will have to do events+investigations
- daily touch point call:
	- needed for collaborating/communicating w off hours resources 

working with jorge and fred:
- zerofox and threat resources
- fred: ir process and playbook, steven will share docs
	- steven wants some feedback on this

- there will be downtime/personal time
- sometimes it will be hard to do interrupted work with the analysts
- steven will add us to distribution list, watch alerts

usual routine:
- nothing new
- jorge is working on XDR

research:
- research XDR - is it really innovative or just marketing?
- one of the hottest things right now (with zerotrust)
- no vendor - cisco, palo alto, arrista
	- dont focus on that, more on "what are the benefits?"
	- jorge and steven and working on the "depth and breadth" of the cyber team to figure out how they can depict a hollistic view of what the team does - "are we already doing what xdr does?" - if so, they will pitch that to management

stevens conference:
- 2nd in command attorney general was there, had a lot of security
- steven learned theres lots of stuff they have to give up to be in the fbi

steven usually goes into office mon-thurs
- other guys rotate

## Jorges intro meeting

- jorge will setup training session with anomali and zerofox

threat intel program:
- help develop playbook as we work through this rotation
- framework - living document, driven by threat landscape
	- ransomware - recently became a part of landscape - biggest threat to healthcare
	- lot of things seen now werent seen 10 y ago
	- hacking started w telecoms, created exploit kits
- as actors shift, defenders have to shift with them
- intel programs need actionable info
	- dissemination has to lead to defensive measures
		- can be organizational , ie. russia-ukraine conflict was nation states, became an alert
	- technical IoCs: team takes the indicators and put into platforms (ie anomali)
	- evens info flows into IR
- lots of processes with stakeholders like vuln mgmt, policy
- intel lifecycle
	- collection
	- analysis
	- dissemination
	- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- threat intel platform (TIP)
	- anomali
	- feedly - can make free accts
	- crowdstrike - detection/response, nextgen AV
- open source
	- virustotal - drop files, domains, searches
	- alienvault - 
- zerofox
	- domain / impersonation takedowns
	- compromised credentials - darkweb monitoring

## Incident Response

ir process document:
- its a living document
- read thru it

crowdstrike:
- detection section: what was run (script)
	- deepblue - forensics tool, powershell; crowdstrike ML picked up as malicious and blocked
- example: user got a file w password in an email
	- fred looked at machine in crowdstrike
	- took file from email and put in malware analytics (cisco tool - takes sample or url, opens in sandbox, analyzes)
	- reached out to user and said its malicious, had user shutdown device and desktop support reimage device

proofpoint:
- can search user emails, check hashes
- decode urls so users cant click to go directly to a link

cylance:
- dont use a lot
- older, non-standard devices that cant use crowdstrike

stealthwatch
- search ip, can see all traffic flows between machine and office
- can categorize potential traffic category
- can search network flows for specific traffic
