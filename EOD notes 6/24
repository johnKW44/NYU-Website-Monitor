Weekly HEAT meeting with Pat

goal: go over any special ticket requests that anyone needs help with, discuss current processes, how to handle tickets

    pat sent tickets outstanding to managers/ray - focus on > 30 days
    some are over 100 days old
    suresh sent hai an email to clear out > 90 day tickets

Brian:

    vuln management team doesnt get a lot of tickets
    most of their tickets are for policy exceptions for old operating systems / medical equipment
    recent ticket example:
        owner is asking for security exception for critical vulnerability
        what to do?
            install AV
            put in patch cycle - infra team does OS patching, limited app patching (only on windows, very low level - ms office/firefox)
        cyberark - privileged access management
            should be only way to access things on nyu env
            if server is not managed thru cyberark - usually reject request, if not have to get risk approval
        exposed to internet?
            reject
        what are possible remediations?
            case by case basis
            upgrade os? 2 choices: upgrade os or just decomission
        what happens when something is not done in time?
            happens more often than not
            people fall behind, even brian
    scanner: Insight VM
    another type of ticker: unblock websites
        too many technologies that block sites
        other teams manage the tech, but brian's team gets the tickets and evalutates
        decide based on policy/standards
        researcher collaborating with outside, other researcher uploaded data on filesharing site, couldnt download
            ended up approving this
            only approved 1 specific url, not even entire domain (wetransfer)
        filesharing could be used for exfiltrating data, ransomware
            esp phishing-based ransomware attacks
        also to protect PHI - adds risk, lawsuits, reputational risk
        porn is not blocked for research purposes
            why not just make this an exception? pat: idk
